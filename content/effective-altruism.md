**Effective altruism** is a philosophy and social movement that applies evidence and reason to determine the most effective ways to improve the world. Effective altruists aim to consider all causes and actions, and then act in the way that brings about the greatest positive impact. It is this broad evidence-based approach that distinguishes effective altruism from traditional altruism or charity.The focus of effective altruism is on global poverty, factory farming, and the long-term future of life on Earth. We are the City University Branch!
 
### Join City Effective Altruism Society!
Most of us want to make a difference in this world, but which causes should we focus on to make the most impact? Is it wrong not to help those who are less fortunate? Should we consider giving money to people we have never met, living in distant countries we have never visited? These are the types of questions we are going to explore by holding exciting speaker events, informal discussions, film/documentary screenings and career workshops. 

We are excited to be a part of this movement and hope youâ€™ll join us.
